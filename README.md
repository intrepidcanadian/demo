Differences to ElizaOS fork

The character file intrepid.character.json file is added

The plugin-bootstrap2 plugin is added

- the bootstrap2 plugin is modified to include the ginseng swap pools and quote as provider, a template for getting a quote from ginseng swap and an action to swap tokens on ginseng swap, and actions to swap USDC/USDT on ginseng swap (a uniswap v3 fork)

- currently the plugin is configured to only show the quote for USDC/USDT on ginseng swap on Conflux Testnet (as this is where the pools are deployed)
